# Lodging and Travel Data Analysis Project
 **This project is a Python-based data analysis and visualization of lodging data. The data includes various attributes such as date, name, category, type, rating, price, and average revenue. The project is structured around a series of Python classes and methods, and it includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using various libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn**

 **Classes
The project defines several classes to represent different types of lodgings:

Lodging: This is the base class that initializes data attributes such as date, name, category, type, rating, price, and average revenue. It also defines a unique ID for each instance and a string representation method.

Travel and Vacation: These are subclasses of the Lodging class, representing different types of lodgings.

HotelRoom, Cottage, and BeachHouse: These are further subclasses of Travel and Vacation, representing more specific types of lodgings.

Data Cleaning and Transformation
The project includes several steps to clean and transform the data:

Importing data from a pickle file.
Writing the data to a CSV file.
Loading the data into a pandas DataFrame.
Handling missing values by replacing them with appropriate values (e.g., median or mode).
Converting data types as necessary.
Extracting year, month, and day from the date column.
Renaming columns for clarity.
Data Visualization
The project uses matplotlib and seaborn to create various visualizations:

Bar charts to show the count of ratings in different categories and the count of each property type.
Box plots to visualize the distribution of price and average revenue.
Line plots to show the trend of average revenue per month for different years.
Scatter plots to observe the relationship between rating category and average revenue, and to visualize the variability of average revenue by month for different categories.
Histograms to visualize the distribution of price and average revenue.
Pie charts to visualize the distribution of a single categorical variable.
The project also includes code to save each visualization as a PNG file.

Testing
The project includes code to test the classes and methods. For example, it creates an instance of the Vacation class and prints its string representation.

Future Work
The project could be extended in several ways:

Incorporating additional data sources.
Implementing more advanced data cleaning and transformation techniques.
Creating more sophisticated visualizations.
Applying machine learning algorithms to make predictions based on the data.
Requirements
Python 3
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
pickle
csv
Usage
To use this project, you would need to have Python installed on your machine along with the required libraries. You can then run the Python script to perform the data analysis and generate the visualizations. The cleaned data is saved as a CSV file, and the visualizations are saved as PNG files. The results can be viewed in any spreadsheet software or image viewer, respectively.
